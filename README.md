This is Todo List WebApp project which is created under LGM internship Program by Vineet Kumar Tiwary.
As part of my web development journey, I conceptualized and developed a dynamic Todo list web app using a robust tech stack, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates my expertise in front-end development and showcases the following key features:

Efficient Task Management: The Todo list web app offers users an efficient way to manage their tasks and stay organized. Through a clean and intuitive interface, users can easily add, modify, and remove tasks, fostering improved productivity and workflow management.

Seamless Data Persistence: To enhance user experience, I implemented task management functionalities with local storage integration. This ensures that the task data remains persistent even after closing the web app, providing users with the convenience of accessing their tasks anytime, anywhere.

Intuitive User Interface: One of the project's focal points was designing an intuitive user interface. The task section dynamically displays tasks, providing real-time updates on task statuses, and facilitating effortless tracking of completed and pending tasks. The user-friendly design enhances usability and promotes a smooth user experience.

Through this project, I honed my skills in creating responsive web applications, employing modern HTML and CSS techniques for a visually appealing layout, and leveraging JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to the app. The Todo list web app serves as a testament to my ability to develop practical and user-centric solutions.
